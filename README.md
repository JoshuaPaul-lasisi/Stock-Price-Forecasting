# Stock Price Forecasting with Machine Learning

## Project Overview

This project demonstrates the application of machine learning techniques for stock price forecasting. It involves data preprocessing, feature engineering, model training, and evaluation. The project also includes walk-forward validation and forecasting of future stock prices.

## Key Features

- Data Preprocessing: Conversion of date format and creation of lagged features.
- Feature Engineering: Use of technical indicators and date-based features.
- Model Building: RandomForestRegressor with hyperparameter tuning.
- Forecasting: Predicting future stock prices and visualizing results.

## How to Run

1. Clone the repository.
2. Install the required packages listed in `requirements.txt`.
3. Run the Jupyter notebook to see the results.

## Results

The model accurately predicted stock prices with a mean squared error of X and an R-Squared of Y during testing.

## Future Work

- Explore the use of different machine learning models such as XGBoost or LSTM.
- Incorporate additional financial indicators and economic data.
